# Genetic Algorithm
A Genetic Algorithm for n-queens problem from scratch optimized till 8 number of queens (can be runnable till 10). Initial population generation, Crossover and mutation (guided mutation or random) are used. The goal is to make sure no Queen attack the other. According to the number of queens an optimal chromosome (array) is produced which contains the position of each queen (counting starts from the bottom of the board). Finally, showing the board layout with the specified number of queens (represented by Q).
